# bootstrap/bootstrap.toml
# ------------------------
# Optional metadata consumed by Castra when planning the bootstrap pipeline.
# The handshake wait step now falls back to SSH reachability, so the demo image
# comes up cleanly without extra overrides. Add an `[ssh]` section here if you
# need to point at a different user, host, port, or identity.
