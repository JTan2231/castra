# bootstrap/bootstrap.toml
# ------------------------
# Optional metadata consumed by Castra while planning and executing the
# bootstrap pipeline. Every key is merged on top of the values derived from
# castra.toml, so you can keep sensitive overrides (like SSH users and identities)
# out of version control when needed.

# The bootstrap wait step now treats SSH reachability as readiness, so no
# handshake identity override is required. Provide SSH metadata below instead.

[ssh]
# Host the bootstrap runner targets once the guest is reachable. Because the
# port forward in castra.toml maps guest SSH to localhost:2222, we keep the
# default host and only override the port below. Update `user` if your image
# bakes in a different SSH principal.
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 2222
user = "root"
# Uncomment the next line if your guest requires a specific identity; use an
# absolute path because `~` is not expanded.
# identity = "/abs/path/to/key"

[env]
# Extra environment keys appended to the values declared in castra.toml. The
# bootstrap script uses them to stamp the remote state directory.
INSTANCE_ID = "devbox-0"
