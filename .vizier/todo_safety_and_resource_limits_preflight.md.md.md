Update (SNAPSHOT v0.7)

Evidence
- Preflight integrated into `up`: CPU/mem headroom with thresholds and --force; disk free checks across state/logs/overlay dirs; port conflict checks including broker; qemu-system presence enforced; friendly, actionable copy.

Open
- Graceful interrupt handling during long operations (downloads, conversions) to avoid partial side effects.
