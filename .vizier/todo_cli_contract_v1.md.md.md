Update (SNAPSHOT v0.7)

Evidence
- Command set stable; empty invocation exits 64; help/version exit 0. Warning summary displayed once per command. Zero-config path changes discovery behavior but preserves exit codes (explicit --config missing still exits 66).

Action
- Keep per-command help synchronized with broker/status semantics and the new managed_image config option.
