Follow-ups â€” v0.7.8

- Add README/CLEAN.md examples demonstrating reclaimed byte totals and overlay safeguards.
- Integration tests to validate: accurate byte totals, permission downgrade behavior in global mode, and managed-image remediation path documented in CLEAN.md.
- Ensure skip-discovery contract mirrored: `--skip-discovery` without `--config`/`--state-root` fails fast with crisp diagnostics; add tests.
