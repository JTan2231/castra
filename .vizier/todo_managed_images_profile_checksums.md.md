Refinement (structured events + docs)
- Emit machine-parseable Events for verification/profile application with result, bytes, checksum, and remediation hints.
- Document cache layout and expected paths; relate to `clean` reclaimed-bytes accounting and corruption remediation.
- Acceptance: events show up in JSONL and reporter; CLEAN examples reflect reclaimed space after invalidation.
