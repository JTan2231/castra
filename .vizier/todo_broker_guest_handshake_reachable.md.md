Progress sync â€” Snapshot v0.7.8

- Fields `reachable` and `last_handshake_age_ms` are present in status JSON; bus capability negotiation is live for guests advertising `bus-v1`. Focus shifts to deterministic handshake Events/log lines (vm, capabilities, session outcome) and legend/docs updates. Acceptance remains non-blocking semantics with stable field names.
