Update (from current vm_fleet.rs)
- Acceptance: vm_fleet.rs is replaced by an agent_roster component whose header reads "AGENTS" (or equivalent). No "VM FLEET" label remains.
- Visual attention mapping aligns with Thread 21 (colors/pulse); selection only affects attention, not routing.
- Pointer: castra-ui/src/components/vm_fleet.rs currently renders VM-specific status and labels; this is the concrete replacement target.
