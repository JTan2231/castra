Refinement (embedder guidance)
- Author AGENTS.md with snippet for using castra as a library with default-features=false and minimal Runtime wiring; clarify feature flags.
- Acceptance: building with --no-default-features succeeds; docs show a working code sample that compiles.
- Cross-link docs/library_usage.md and Cargo.toml feature table.
Cross-links: Thread 11 in snapshot (Library API for embedders).
