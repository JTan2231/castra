Narrowing — docs follow-up added (v0.7.2)
- Remaining action: Update AGENTS.md with a minimal embedding example and explicit feature guidance (disable default features, enable only what’s needed). Link to docs/library_usage.md.
- Acceptance unchanged: AGENTS.md must include a snippet and call out `default-features = false`.
- Evidence anchor: Current AGENTS.md is a placeholder and lacks embedder guidance.
