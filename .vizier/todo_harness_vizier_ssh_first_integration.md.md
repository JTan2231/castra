Update (verification targets)
- Golden stream tests to be added under castra-harness exercising unified events with agent addressing. Include vizier.ssh.* events mapped to agent.id.
- Ensure no reliance on broker/bus in harness code paths. Confirm by searching for broker/bus modules or envs; test asserts no handshake/log dirs are created during a session.
- Anchor: reuse semantics from castra-ui/src/ssh/mod.rs but keep implementation choice open (copy vs shared module).
