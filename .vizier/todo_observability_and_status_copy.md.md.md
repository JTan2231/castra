Update (SNAPSHOT v0.7)

Evidence
- Status table and legend implemented with color-on-tty; widths computed for stable layout. Logs tailer supports --tail/--follow, labels sources with colored prefixes; degrades gracefully when files are missing.

Open
- Add reachable state once broker handshake exists; consider truncation/ellipsis for very long VM names.
