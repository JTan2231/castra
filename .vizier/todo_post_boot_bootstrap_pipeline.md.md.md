Progress
- Added a unix-gated integration test (`bootstrap_pipeline_runs_and_is_idempotent`) that exercises the happy-path bootstrap pipeline with stubbed ssh/scp binaries.
- The test verifies handshake gating, transfer/apply/verify steps, stamp persistence, log durability, and the NoOp replay path while asserting structured events.

Impact
- Provides executable coverage for Thread 12’s core acceptance criteria without requiring real network credentials, reducing regression risk as the pipeline evolves.

Next
- Layer focused tests around failure paths (connect/transfer/apply) once error surface wiring is finalized.
