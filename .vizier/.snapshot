SNAPSHOT v0.12.1 — TODOs rebased onto Vizier-less model

Diff vs v0.12.0
- Rebased product-level threads and acceptance on agent-owned sessions (no vizier.remote as a signal source) in several TODOs.
- No scope/priorities changed; vizier-removal workstreams remain W1→W5.

Threads touched
- Thread 21 — Operational clarity (Attention model): source of truth now UI-managed agent sessions + harness metadata; status/footer/roster acceptance updated accordingly.
- Thread 31 — Agent-first interaction model: first-message roundtrip explicitly over SSH agent sessions; vm_fleet deprecated in favor of roster.
- Thread 40 — Post-removal stabilization: shutdown lifecycle observability notes routed through agent sessions, not vizier.*.
- Thread 50 — Vizier Removal: workstreams unchanged (Core bootstrap W1; Harness simplification W2; UI agent lifecycle W3; Scripts/tooling W4; Docs W5). Open questions remain active.

Unaffected threads
- Ephemeral VM storage & cleanup: still valid; independent of Vizier.
- CLI/Core removal of VM-selection surfaces: aligned with agent-first; no further edits needed beyond existing TODO.
- Core library composability: clarified it emits core events independent of vizier.remote; otherwise unchanged.

Why this change
- Ensure all guidance and acceptance criteria reflect the pivot: UI now owns agent SSH sessions; harness provides discovery metadata; core remains VM/bootstrap-only.

Next steps
- Execute W1→W5; then close or merge open questions into concrete acceptance in affected TODOs.
