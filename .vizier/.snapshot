SNAPSHOT v0.10.0-pre — Castra (Agent-centric orchestration) — Busless vizier pivot

Edits since previous snapshot
- Housekeeping: Merged and removed duplicate TODOs across Threads 20, 30, and 31. Canonical TODOs retained; all *.md.md and todo_todo_* duplicates deleted. Remaining TODO set now maps 1:1 to active threads without parallel duplicates.

Active threads (intent + acceptance deltas)
- Thread 2 — Cooperative shutdown lifecycle: unchanged.

- Thread 12 — Post-boot bootstrap pipeline: unchanged.

- Thread 13 — Stateless runs (ephemeral-only): unchanged.

- Thread 20 — Harness ↔ Core integration (Vizier-first): unchanged; duplicates pruned.

- Thread 21 — Operational clarity (Attention model): unchanged.

- Thread 22 — UI onboarding docs (tutorial set): unchanged.

- Thread 30 — Busless architecture cutover (Core): unchanged; duplicates pruned. Canonical TODO: todo_busless_architecture_cutover_core.md.

- Thread 31 — Agent-first interaction model: unchanged; duplicates pruned. Canonical TODOs: todo_cli_and_core_remove_vm_selection_surfaces.md, todo_ui_components_agent_roster_pivot.md, todo_event_contract_v1.md (cross-thread with 20).

Current code state (observable surfaces)
- Core: options.rs still contains broker/bus-related types and VM-oriented options; broker/bus modules/tests/scripts exist.
- Harness: Unified, agent-addressed stream not yet implemented; SSH integration planned. No change in code state from last snapshot.
- UI: vm_fleet.rs still VM-centric.

Narrative themes
Unchanged.

Direction of travel
Unchanged; reduced organizational noise by removing duplicate TODOs.

Cross-links
- Canonical TODOs reflect: Thread 20 (harness stream/tests), Thread 30 (busless core surfaces), Thread 31 (agent-first event/UI/CLI).

Editorial housekeeping
- Deleted duplicate TODO files: busless_architecture_cutover_core.*.md (dupes), event_contract_v1.*.md (dupes), ui_vertical_slice_up_status.md.md, todo_todo_* dupes, harness_vizier_ssh_first_integration.md.md, ui_components_agent_roster_pivot.* dupes, cli_and_core_remove_vm_selection_surfaces.* dupes.
- Remaining TODO list is authoritative; future additions must link to active threads to avoid re-duplication.
