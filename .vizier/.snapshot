SNAPSHOT v0.9.8 — Castra (VM orchestration harness)

Edits since v0.9.7
- Housekeeping: removed duplicate/stale TODO stubs; canonicalize threads to a single source of truth.
- Thread 20 (UI ↔ Core integration: composable first): establish a stable consumption path from the existing core event stream without coupling the UI to core internals; preserve library usability outside the UI. Initial scope: read-only event subscription powering a minimal vertical slice.
- Thread 21 (Operational clarity in the UI): define an attention model that turns core signals into actionable, low-noise visuals; bias toward "video‑game" clarity without hiding detail. Map severities, progress, blockers, and remediation hints to consistent UI affordances.

Active threads (intent + acceptance deltas)
- Thread 2 — Cooperative shutdown lifecycle: unchanged; remains targeted for surfacing effective timeouts via CLI/config and JSON. UI will display these once available (see Thread 21 mapping for severities/remediation).

- Thread 12 — Post-boot bootstrap pipeline: unchanged; JSON BootstrapSummary remains the contract the UI will consume for completion banners and logs.

- Thread 13 — Stateless runs (ephemeral-only): unchanged; UI will surface ephemerality reminders inline on Up/Down views.

- Thread 20 — UI ↔ Core integration (Composable first):
  Intent: Connect castra-ui to castra-core via the existing JSON event stream (process boundary OK) while ensuring castra-core remains a usable library independently of the UI.
  Acceptance:
  - There is a documented, semver-governed "Event Contract v1" that the UI consumes (no reliance on private structs).
  - castra-core exposes a public library surface that can run operations (up/down/status/clean/bootstrap) and emit the same events to an external subscriber; examples demonstrate library use without the UI.
  - castra-ui can launch an Up operation and render live per-VM progress using only the contract (no private imports).
  Anchors: castra-core/src/core/events.rs; castra-core/src/app/*; castra-ui/src/controller/*; castra-ui/src/components/*; docs/AGENTS.md; castra-ui/AGENTS.md.

- Thread 21 — Operational clarity (Attention model):
  Intent: Maximize signal while reducing noise. Create a severity + attention model mapping to visuals/components (roster badges, status footer, message log). Support grouping and rate-limited bursts.
  Acceptance:
  - A design doc enumerates event classes → attention levels (info/progress/warn/error/blocker) with remediation hints where available.
  - UI renders: roster with per-VM status badges; status footer with aggregate health and active operations; message log with grouping and collapse of repetitive events.
  - Visual style trends toward "video‑game" clarity: critical items pulse/highlight; resolved issues de-emphasize; nothing is hidden by default.
  Anchors: castra-ui/src/components/{roster_sidebar.rs,status_footer.rs,message_log.rs,vm_fleet.rs}; castra-ui/src/controller/command.rs; castra-core/src/core/events.rs.

Current code state (observable surfaces)
- Core already emits structured JSON events usable by automation; TTY is separate. CLI/library split exists.
- UI skeleton exists (castra-ui) with components for roster, message log, shell, status footer, and a controller; not yet wired to core event stream.

Narrative themes
1) Robust lifecycle; 10) Trustworthy bootstrap; 12) Day‑1 productivity; 13) Ephemeral-only policy; 20) Composability-first UI integration; 21) Operational clarity with high-contrast visuals.

Direction of travel
- Thread 20: publish Event Contract v1; expose/confirm library emission of events; implement UI vertical slice for Up using process-boundary JSON; document semver policy.
- Thread 21: codify attention model; map core events → UI affordances; implement grouping/throttling to reduce log spam without losing detail.

Cross-links
- UI consumes Thread 2/12/13 outputs; no schema changes are introduced by UI. Library examples double as contract tests.

Editorial housekeeping
- Duplicate TODOs removed; snapshot reflects UI integration as the next major focus while preserving ongoing threads.
