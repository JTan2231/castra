SNAPSHOT v0.9.2 — Castra (VM orchestration harness)

Edits since last snapshot refresh
- Housekeeping: Removed malformed duplicate TODO files (*.md.md variants). Canonical TODOs remain intact.
- Thread 13 TODO clarified to reflect policy: ephemeral-only; removed residual mentions of a persistence mode and tightened acceptance around validation, cleanup, and CLEAN integration.

Active threads (intent + acceptance)
- Thread 2 — Cooperative shutdown lifecycle (sequencing shipped): Before host termination, attempt guest‑cooperative shutdown with ordered, observable events and bounded waits.
  Progress:
  - Runtime emits CooperativeAttempted(method, timeout_ms) and CooperativeSucceeded/CooperativeTimedOut prior to TERM/KILL.
  - Unavailable channel path handled; errors surface as CooperativeTimedOut(reason: ChannelError) with diagnostics.
  - down performs concurrent per‑VM shutdown with live streaming; ShutdownComplete includes total_ms.
  Next slice:
  - Expose/propagate cooperative/TERM/KILL timeouts via CLI/options with clear defaults/help; render method + timeout/reason fields consistently in CLI/JSON and add remediation hints. Document example payloads and note 0ms unavailable path.
  Acceptance (per VM):
  - Event order: ShutdownRequested → CooperativeAttempted(method, timeout_ms) → CooperativeSucceeded | CooperativeTimedOut(timeout_ms, reason, detail?) → Escalation(SIGTERM)? → Escalation(SIGKILL)? → ShutdownComplete(outcome: Graceful|Forced, total_ms).
  Anchors: src/core/runtime.rs; src/core/events.rs; src/core/options.rs; src/core/reporter.rs; src/app/down.rs.

- Thread 10 — Managed images: structured verification/profile events (shipped; docs/durability pending): Emit machine‑parseable events during verification/profile so downstream tools can rely on them.
  Shipped in v0.8.5:
  - Event variants and support types added; CLEAN links reclaimed‑bytes evidence with verification results where available.
  Outstanding:
  - Reporter durability smoke tests across sinks; document field stability with example payloads.
  Anchors: src/managed/mod.rs; src/core/events.rs; src/core/logs.rs; src/core/reporter.rs; src/core/operations/clean.rs; src/app/clean.rs; CLEAN.md.

- Thread 12 — Post‑boot bootstrap pipeline (stamp‑free pipeline implemented; UX polish next): After first successful broker handshake for a VM within a run, perform host‑driven bootstrap via per‑VM script/payload with optional metadata; no host‑side stamp persistence.
  New behavior (shipped):
  - Stamps purged: no stamp reads/writes; stamp fields in events/logs remain null for schema stability. Repeated up invocations in auto/always attempt bootstrap again.
  - Configuration: Global [bootstrap] and per‑VM [vms.bootstrap] parse mode, handshake_timeout_secs, remote_dir, env, and optional verify_command/verify_path. Per‑VM overrides take precedence; conflicts validated.
  - Artifact discovery: Script/payload resolved under project_root/bootstrap/<vm>/ by default; optional bootstrap.toml alongside script provides ssh/verify/remote_dir/env overrides. Payload directory is optional; missing payload is a warning, not fatal.
  - SSH inference: Defaults (root@127.0.0.1:22) with StrictHostKeyChecking=no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null; if SSH host/port unchanged and a TCP forward to guest 22 exists, host port is inferred from port_forwards.
  - Steps and outcomes: WaitHandshake → Connect (ssh true) → Transfer (scp script + payload) → Apply (exec staged run.sh; recognizes Castra:noop sentinel) → Verify (optional command/path). Events and per‑VM JSON logs capture steps, durations, and final status Success|NoOp; durable logs written under logs/bootstrap.
  - Failure handling: Each failed step emits BootstrapFailed and writes a single per‑VM log with diagnostic detail and hints; handshake timeout is explicit and bounded by config/metadata.
  Remaining (UX/plan mode):
  - Add --plan dry‑run that reports intent and resolved inputs without side effects.
  - TTY progress lines and concise completion summaries with hints and durable log paths (non‑JSON only). Help/docs updates and Quick Start/Troubleshooting.
  Acceptance:
  - No stamp persistence; Auto/Always re‑attempts; per‑VM overrides honored with precedence; failures are observable with durable logs; JSON schema unchanged.
  Anchors: src/config.rs; src/core/bootstrap.rs; src/core/status.rs; src/core/reporter.rs; src/app/up.rs; src/cli.rs; docs/BOOTSTRAP.md.

- Thread 13 — Stateless runs (ephemeral‑only write layer + cleanup): All VM disk changes are discarded on shutdown; there is no built‑in persistence or export. Users must manually export via SSH before shutdown.
  Policy (locked):
  - Ephemerality is the only supported mode. Any attempt to enable persistence via CLI/config is rejected with a clear, actionable error that points to SSH export.
  Intent:
  - Default and only mode uses a non‑persistent write layer over managed base images; guest mutations are discarded on shutdown (graceful or forced).
  - Deterministic teardown removes ephemeral layers and per‑VM temp dirs post‑exit; bounded orphan cleanup on next command after crashes/reboots.
  - CLEAN reports reclaimed bytes from ephemeral layers; messaging during up/down reminds users that changes will be discarded and suggests SSH for export.
  Acceptance:
  - Pristine restarts from the same base; no residual ephemeral artifacts after normal shutdown; opportunistic orphan reclamation without blocking healthy ops.
  - No CLI/opts/env allow persistence; validation errors include remediation guidance ("export via SSH before shutdown").
  - CLEAN integrates reclaimed‑bytes reporting; stable JSON schemas preserved.
  - Up/Down output (TTY/JSON) clearly indicates ephemeral‑only behavior.
  Anchors: src/core/operations/up.rs; src/app/up.rs; src/core/operations/clean.rs; src/app/clean.rs; src/core/runtime.rs; src/app/down.rs; docs/BOOTSTRAP.md; CLEAN.md; CLI help.

Current code state (observable surfaces)
- CLI/library split via feature gating; default includes CLI; library builds with no‑default‑features.
- Status exposes broker reachability and bus health; designed to remain non‑blocking.
- Ports view with stable columns; Clean command with byte accounting/safeguards; links managed‑image evidence when available.
- Managed images emit structured verification/profile events; app/up.rs renders size/duration and steps; automation can consume JSON streams.
- Down command emits cooperative shutdown events before escalation and renders per‑VM shutdown durations; forced shutdown returns success with warning.
- Bootstrap (stamp‑free) now driven by config + optional per‑VM metadata and local script/payload directories; SSH defaults hardened; port‑forward inference supported. Per‑VM durable logs written; NoOp reported via script sentinel; JSON schema unchanged.
- Stateless runs policy captured (ephemeral‑only); implementation remains pending for cleanup/validation/UI polish.

Narrative themes
1) Robust VM lifecycle — predictable, observable cooperative shutdown with bounded waits and clear outcomes.
10) Trustworthy bootstrap — verified managed images with structured events powering automation; idempotence comes from the runner, not host stamps.
12) Day‑1 productivity — host‑driven post‑boot configuration triggered by real connectivity signals, with improved usability and discoverability.
13) Ephemeral‑only by policy — guests are disposable; only host evidence (logs/events) is durable; users export via SSH if needed.

Direction of travel
- Thread 2: expose timeouts in CLI/options, render fields consistently, and document payloads; keep exit‑success semantics on forced shutdowns.
- Thread 10: add smoke tests across reporters and document stable fields with examples in docs and CLEAN.md.
- Thread 12: deliver --plan and TTY UX polish; update docs/help; keep JSON schema stable; continue refining hints and durable log paths.
- Thread 13: implement cleanup + validation + UX notices; integrate reclaimed‑bytes with CLEAN; ensure crash/reboot orphan reclamation.

Cross‑links
- CLEAN to integrate ephemeral layer reclamation (Thread 13) alongside managed‑image evidence.
- Lifecycle canonical TODO: todo_cooperative_shutdown_lifecycle.md (sequencing shipped; configurability/rendering/docs next).
- Thread 12 canonical TODO: todo_post_boot_bootstrap_pipeline.md (stamp‑free pipeline + UX polish/plan mode).
- Thread 13 canonical TODO: todo_ephemeral_vm_storage_and_cleanup.md (ephemeral‑only policy + cleanup + UX notices).

Editorial housekeeping
- Canonical TODO files remain:
  - todo_cooperative_shutdown_lifecycle.md
  - todo_post_boot_bootstrap_pipeline.md
  - todo_ephemeral_vm_storage_and_cleanup.md
- Snapshot version bumped to v0.9.2 to record TODO cleanup and tightened Thread 13 brief.
