SNAPSHOT v0.7.10 — Castra (VM orchestration harness)

Edits since last snapshot
- Bus back-pressure observability shipped: broker now emits deterministic WARN log lines and structured JSONL records (bus-events.jsonl) with reason/action/detail for slow_consumer, queue_full, heartbeat_timeout, io_error, and protocol_error; actions include reject and disconnect. Added unit test persisting both log and event.
- Session paths updated to record back-pressure on publish ack failures, heartbeat ack failures, subscription overflows, heartbeat timeouts, IO/protocol errors, and during main loop errors; reconnection semantics unchanged.
- Housekeeping: removed duplicate TODO file (todo_castra_bus_subscribe_heartbeat.md.md).

Active threads (intent + acceptance)
- Thread 1 — Discovery semantics gap [tests/docs pending]: `--skip-discovery` requires explicit config/path; zero filesystem walking when set; enforce across status/up/down/ports/logs/bus and clean. Anchors: src/app/common.rs; src/core/options.rs; src/cli.rs; CLEAN.md cross-link.
- Thread 2 — Lifecycle gap: add guest‑cooperative shutdown before TERM→KILL with ordered Events and configurable timeouts [timeouts shipped; events+mechanism pending]. Anchors: src/core/runtime.rs; src/core/events.rs; src/core/options.rs; src/app/down.rs.
- Thread 3 — Broker reachability [success evidence delivered; denial/timeout tests/docs pending]: maintain non-blocking freshness via reachable/last_handshake_age_ms; emit deterministic handshake logs/events (success path done); finalize denial/timeout-path tests and docs examples. Anchors: src/core/status.rs; src/core/broker.rs; src/app/status.rs; src/core/logs.rs.
- Thread 6 — Ports active mode [delivered]: `--active` view shows runtime-active forwards; stable columns; fast path. Follow-up: doc snippet + smoke test (tracked in ports_active_mode_docs_test). Anchors: src/core/ports.rs; src/app/ports.rs; src/core/runtime.rs.
- Thread 10 — Managed images [profile+checksums shipped]: emit machine-parseable verification/profile Events; document cache layout and remediation; align with CLEAN reclaimed-bytes accounting. Anchors: src/managed/mod.rs; src/core/logs.rs/reporter.rs; docs.
- Thread 11 — Library API for embedders: feature gating in place; add AGENTS.md guidance/snippet for using castra as a library with default-features=false. Anchors: src/lib.rs; Cargo.toml; docs/AGENTS.md.
- Thread 12 — Post-boot bootstrap pipeline: host bootstrap reacts to fresh handshake and applies Nix flake over SSH; idempotent via hash stamps; observable logs under state root. Depends on Threads 3 and 10. Anchors: docs/BOOTSTRAP.md; workflows.init hooks; broker/status fields.
- Thread 13 — Castra Bus [back‑pressure shipped; core delivered]: broker supports subscribe/ack/heartbeat with durable publish acks, bounded limits, session timeout/cleanup; now emits back‑pressure WARN logs and structured bus-events.jsonl records with reason/action/detail. Status exposes bus_subscribed, last_publish_age_ms, last_heartbeat_age_ms; BUS and BUS AGE columns/legend shipped. Remaining: reconnection/timeout edge‑case tests and BUS.md examples covering back‑pressure; ensure status non‑blocking across these cases. Anchors: src/core/broker.rs; src/core/status.rs; src/core/events.rs; src/core/logs.rs; src/cli.rs; src/core/operations/bus.rs; src/app/bus.rs; BUS.md.
- Thread 14 — First-class clean [delivered]: `castra clean` implemented with events/byte accounting and safeguards. Follow-ups: docs/examples, integration tests for byte totals and permission downgrades, and skip-discovery pairing tests (tracked in clean_docs_and_tests). Anchors: src/cli.rs; src/app/clean.rs; src/core/operations/clean.rs; src/core/project.rs; src/core/runtime.rs.

Current code state (observable surfaces)
- Versioning/MSRV: build.rs injects version/short SHA; CLI reports it. README declares MSRV=1.77; docs/RELEASING.md present.
- Feature gating: default features include `cli`; building with --no-default-features succeeds and excludes CLI. AGENTS.md guidance still missing.
- Skip discovery: Enforcement active across status/up/down/ports/logs/clean and bus — `--skip-discovery` must pair with `--config` (or `--state-root` for clean-only state). Help text to reflect stricter semantics; tests for no-walk and exit codes outstanding.
- Broker status: `reachable` and `last_handshake_age_ms` present in JSON; handshakes persist normalized capabilities and session outcome; deterministic success log/event emitted. Legend updated; denial/timeout-path examples/tests pending.
- Broker bus: sessions implement subscribe/ack/heartbeat; publish frames acknowledged after durability; heartbeats tracked with 60s timeout; subscription state cleared on disconnect; new back‑pressure instrumentation logs and persists structured bus events.
- Host bus operations: `bus publish` writes JSON lines with timestamp/vm/topic/payload to shared and per-VM logs; `bus tail` tails shared or per-VM logs with follow and tail count; messages printed with standard log UX.
- Status UI: BUS and BUS AGE columns added; library surfaces VmStatusRow.bus_subscribed, last_publish_age, last_heartbeat_age while preserving non-blocking semantics; diagnostics for future-dated timestamps.
- Managed images: Alpine boot profile delivered; checksum/size verification and improved diagnostics in place; emits success copy. Machine-parseable Events and docs pending.
- Ports: `--active` shipped; runtime inspection marks Active/Inactive with `inactive_reason`; columns stable; diagnostics on inspection failure. Doc snippet/smoke test pending.
- Clean: Command shipped with scopes/toggles; emits CleanupProgress events and returns structured CleanOutcome; safeguards for running processes with `--force` override. Docs/examples/tests follow-ups pending.
- Gaps outstanding: cooperative shutdown phase/events; denial/timeout handshake tests/docs; managed‑image structured events; AGENTS.md; bus reconnection/timeout edge‑case tests and BUS.md back‑pressure examples; CLEAN examples/tests; skip‑discovery tests (including bus/clean surfaces).

Narrative themes
1) UX‑first CLI contract — explicit‑config with skip‑discovery; consistent, actionable errors; tests back the promise, including bus and clean subcommands.
2) Robust VM lifecycle — cooperative shutdown phases with events/timeouts; copy matches behavior.
3) Clear connectivity signals — stable, non‑blocking status fields; recognizable handshake logs/events; capability‑aware without regressions.
6) Networking clarity — ports --active with stable columns, reasons, and fast path.
10) Trustworthy bootstrap — verified managed images and applied boot profile events enabling post‑boot provisioning.
11) Embedder clarity — document how to consume castra as a library without CLI.
12) Day‑1 productivity — documented, repeatable post‑boot environment application keyed to handshakes.
13) Host‑centric messaging — capability‑gated bus for guest↔host eventing, durable logs, and host tooling; now with explicit back‑pressure observability.
14) Safe housekeeping — first‑class clean to recover space and resolve cache corruption.

Direction of travel
- Finalize Thread 1 with tests and uniform enforcement across commands (including bus and clean); assert no-walk behavior and help copy.
- Implement cooperative shutdown events/behavior (Thread 2) honoring lifecycle waits; emit ordered events.
- Thread 3: add denial/timeout-path test coverage and docs examples for handshake evidence; maintain non-blocking guarantees.
- Thread 13: add reconnection/timeout edge‑case tests exercising new back‑pressure instrumentation; update BUS.md with examples; verify status remains non‑blocking under stress.
- Emit structured Events for managed image verification/profile and document cache (Thread 10); cross-link to `clean`.
- Author AGENTS.md embedder guide (Thread 11).
- Expand CLEAN.md/README examples; add integration tests for byte totals and permission downgrade behavior (Thread 14 follow-ups).

Cross-links
- BOOTSTRAP.md consumes Thread 3/10 fields and events; CLEAN.md enforces Thread 1/2/10; BUS.md reflects Thread 13 protocol, status signals, and new back‑pressure/event examples; docs/library_usage.md to surface OperationOutput fields for embedders.
