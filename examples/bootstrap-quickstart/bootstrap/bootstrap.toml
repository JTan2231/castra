# ------------------------
# Optional metadata consumed by Castra when planning the bootstrap pipeline.
# The bundled Alpine guest advertises itself as `alpine` during the broker
# handshake, so we override the expected identity to match what the guest
# actually reports. Without this, Castra would wait for `quickstart-0` (the
# expanded VM name) and time out before any SSH work begins.
